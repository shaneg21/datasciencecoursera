GitHub Documents
----------------

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

Including Code
--------------

You can include R code in the document as follows:

``` r
print("This is a Markdown File")
```

    ## [1] "This is a Markdown File"

Including Plots
---------------

You can also embed plots, for example:

![](Markdown_Assignment_files/figure-markdown_github/pressure-1.png)

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
